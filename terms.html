                        3. The FriendComp Platform and FriendComp Services

                        The FriendComp Platform functions as a digital community for people to gift friends and family by sending and receiving gift credits. The FriendComp Platform directs unique offers to users related to their geographic location. The FriendComp Platform and FriendComp Services are made available   our mobile applications available for iPhone.

                        <br /><br />

                        A. Registering Your Account

                        <br /><br />

                        A.1 To be able to use FriendComp Services, you are required to download the FriendComp Application via the iTunes store and allow us to connect your Social Network account to the FriendComp Platform. When registering for a FriendComp Account, you agree to provide only accurate and complete information and to keep this information up-to-date.

                        <br /><br />

                        A.2 FriendComp relies on the relevant Social Network to authorize you as a user of FriendComp Services. You are solely responsible for any and all access to your FriendComp Account and the FriendComp Platform by persons using your Social Network account. If someone other than yourself accesses your FriendComp Account or the FriendComp Platform by using your Social Network account or Social Network password, we will rely on that Social Network account and Social Network password and you agree that such access to the FriendComp Platform will constitute access made by you personally. If you become aware that your Social Network account or Social Network password is being used without authorization, please notify us immediately by sending an email to info@FriendComp.com.

                        <br /><br />

                        A.3 Individuals and entities whose privilege to use FriendComp Services has previously been terminated by FriendComp may not register for another FriendComp Account, nor may you allow any of those individuals or entities to use your FriendComp Account on your behalf. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that your use of your Social Network’s website is governed by the Social Network’s terms of use and its privacy policy, including, without limitation, password and account security policies.

                        <br /><br />

                        A.4 By utilizing your Social Network credentials to log into the FriendComp Platform or to use the FriendComp Services, you expressly authorize FriendComp to receive certain information that is available on or through your Social Network account, including, your profile information (including your profile photo), friends or follower names, privacy settings and certain other information that will be disclosed to you, and approved by you, during the log-in process; and you also authorize FriendComp to generate and publish on your Social Network news feed and timeline (as applicable) actions you take on the FriendComp Platform or while using the FriendComp Services, and to allow you to interact with your Social Network friends on the FriendComp Platform or while using the FriendComp Services. You agree to allow each such Social Network to receive information concerning the actions you take on the FriendComp Platform or your use of FriendComp Services. In the event you no longer want the FriendComp Platform or FriendComp Services to publish your FriendComp activity, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which the FriendComp Platform or FriendComp Services interact with your Social Network account, you can always disable aspects of this feature by changing your Social Network application settings.

                        <br /><br />

                        B. Giving and Receiving gift credits

                        <br /><br />

                        B.1 FriendComp Services offer you the opportunity to give and receive electronic gift credits provided by various third-party businesses (”Merchants”) to be used for the purchase of products and services at the  brick and mortar stores of the Merchants.   The friends available through your Social Network profile   are eligible to receive gift credits from the user.

                        <br /><br />

                        B.2 Users of FriendComp Services can choose to purchase gift credits (”Paid Gift Credits”) . Paid gift credits are offered by FriendComp in several predetermined values. To give a Paid gift credit to a friend, you first select the Merchant from which you would like to purchase the Paid Gift Credit and then choose the value of the Paid gift credit. To purchase a Paid gift credit you choose the payment type (  debit or credit cards), provide the appropriate information (collectively the ”Credit Card Information”) and complete your purchase. Shortly thereafter you will receive a confirmation of the purchase and the amount charged to your PayPal or credit card account by FriendComp. Paid gift credits will not be available for use until full payment has been made.

                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />

                        C. Redemption of Gift Credits

                        <br /><br />

                        C.1 To redeem a gift credit that you have received and to use the credit to purchase a product or service from a Merchant, you either go to the Merchant’s physical business and display the Gift Credit on your Device to the Merchant’s representative or provide Gift Credit information at the Merchant’s website.   For all   Paid Gift Credits you must redeem the full value of the Gift Credit in one visit. No cash-backs or other credit will be accepted by Merchants (unless they are required to do so under applicable laws). You may also be required to present a valid photo ID when redeeming a Gift Credit in the Merchant’s store or other business.     Please never activate a Gift Credit unless you are about to complete your purchase.

                        <br /><br />

                        C.3 Merchants are obligated to honor  FriendComp Gift Credits in compliance with this Agreement and applicable laws. If a Merchant refuses to honor a valid Gift Credit, then FriendComp will refund the paid portion of the Gift Credit in the form of a credit for a new Gift Credit, unless other compensation is required by applicable law. In order to receive such credit, you must provide the following information, in writing, to info@FriendComp.com:

                        <em>Identification of the Gift Credit and the Merchant from which you sought to redeem the Gift Credit;</em>

                        <em>Information regarding the date, time and circumstances under which the Merchant refused to redeem the Gift Credit;</em>

                        <em>The email address associated with the Social Network account that you used to access the FriendComp Platform; and</em>

                        <em>A statement, which is legally binding, in which you certify that the Gift Credit has never been redeemed with the Merchant.</em>

                        C.4 Gift Credits may not be redeemed as payment for taxes, tips, prior balances, shipping or handling. Neither FriendComp nor its Merchants are responsible for lost or stolen Gift Credits or Gift Credit reference numbers.

                        <br /><br />

                        D. Right of Withdrawal and Refunds

                        <br /><br />

                        You are entitled to withdraw from your purchase of a Paid Gift Credit  within fourteen (14) days from the day you purchased the Gift Credit (provided that the Gift Credit has not yet been redeemed at that point in time) by sending a notice thereof to info@FriendComp.com. Upon receiving the notice, FriendComp will provide a full refund for the Paid Gift  to the person who paid for the Gift Credit. After this time period expires, we do not provide any refunds, except when a valid Gift Credit cannot be redeemed because a Merchant has ceased to carry on its business. FriendComp cannot provide any refund in relation to an expired Gift Credit, unless required to do so by mandatory law in the jurisdiction of the purchaser of the Gift Credit.

                        <br /><br />

                        E. Merchant Responsibility

                        <br /><br />

                        FriendComp provides and sells Gift Credits to be redeemed at the physical or online businesses of its Merchants. However, the Merchants are the issuers of the Gift Credits and the sellers of the products or services for which a Gift Credit can be redeemed. By receiving a Gift Credit, the user acquires only the right to redeem the Gift Credit online or at the business of the participating Merchant in accordance with the terms set out in this Agreement and the terms of the specific Gift Credit. FriendComp does not have any responsibility for the quality of the products or services provided by Merchants, and FriendComp expressly disclaims any and all liability for any direct or indirect damages, costs or other losses related to products or services provided by Merchants to users.

                        <br /><br />

                        F. Specific Gift Credit Terms

                        <br /><br />

                        All Gift Credits are issued with specific terms, such as the period during which the Gift Credit is valid and the date it expires. These specific terms appear only on the Gift Credit itself. Should there be any conflict between the specific terms stated on the Gift Credit and this Agreement, the specific terms will prevail.

                        <br /><br />

                        G. Special Promotional Activities

                        <br /><br />

                        From time to time FriendComp may offer special promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes intended to provide incentives to purchase Gift Credits. The applicable rules for such special promotional activities will be posted on the FriendComp website in connection with the description of each promotion.

                        <br /><br />

                        4. Equipment

                        You are solely responsible for the maintenance of your Device or any other equipment used to access the FriendComp Platform and FriendComp Services. You are also required to have the most recent version of the software for the FriendComp Platform in order to use FriendComp Services.

                        <br /><br />

                        5. Limited License and Conditional Use of FriendComp Services

                        A. FriendComp grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable license to access and use the FriendComp Platform and FriendComp Services for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

You expressly acknowledge and consent to such constructive trust, and expressly agree to, upon written notice from FriendComp, execute and deliver any and all documents deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate by FriendComp to evidence the due assignment to FriendComp of any such Commercial Work.

                        <br /><br />

                        C.

                        A. Governing Law; Attorneys’ Fees.

                        <br /><br />

                        This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Hawaii, without giving effect to any of its conflict of law principles. Except as provided in Section 18.B below (and claims proceeding in any small claims court), all disputes arising out of or related to your use of the FriendComp Platform or FriendComp Services shall be subject to arbitration or, where not required by this Agreement to be arbitrated, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Hawaii and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.   In the event any litigation is brought by you or FriendComp in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation will be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.

                        <br /><br />

                        B. Dispute Resolution

                        <br /><br />

                        This Section 18.B includes a mandatory arbitration provision for certain claims. The claims to which this section applies are described below. This section limits your rights. Specifically, you understand that you and FriendComp are waiving the right to sue in court and have a jury trial for certain claims.

                        <br /><br />

                        B.1 Claims.

                        <br /><br />

                        a. All disputes, controversies or claims related to this Agreement (i) that, with respect to any single plaintiff (whether you or FriendComp), involve a claim for monetary damages actually incurred by that plaintiff alone of less than USD$10,000.00, or (ii) that involve any form of consumer complaint or dispute regarding the FriendComp Platform or FriendComp Services (each, a ”Claim”) are subject to the provisions of this Section 18.B concerning negotiations and binding arbitration.

                        <br /><br />

                        b. For clarification, you and FriendComp agree that the following disputes, controversies or claims are not deemed to be ”Claims” under this Agreement and therefore are not subject to the provisions of this Section 18.B: (i) any disputes, controversies or claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, or based on any violation or infringement of, any of your or FriendComp’s intellectual property rights; (ii) any disputes, controversies or claims related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; (iii) any disputes, controversies or claims related to this Agreement that, with respect to any single plaintiff (whether you or FriendComp), involve a claim for monetary damages actually incurred by that plaintiff alone equal to or greater than USD$10,000.00; (iv) any disputes, controversies or claims related to your impermissible commercial use of the FriendComp Platform or FriendComp Services, and/or (v) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration. As some jurisdictions do not allow for some of the dispute resolution provisions set forth in this Agreement, some of these provisions may not apply to you.

                        <br /><br />

                        B.2 Negotiations.

                        <br /><br />

                        Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you and FriendComp agree to first attempt to negotiate any Claim (except those disputes, controversies or claims expressly provided in Section 18.B.1.b above) informally for at least thirty (30) days. Negotiations will begin upon written notice. FriendComp will send its notice to your billing or other physical address (if on file with FriendComp) and email you a copy to the email address you have provided. You will send your notice to:

                        <br /><br />

                        B.3 Binding Arbitration.

                        <br /><br />

                        a. If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations within the above thirty (30) day period, you and FriendComp agree that, except as provided in Section 18.B.1.b, all Claims will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the ”JAMS Rules”) and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 18.B.3 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 18.B.3 will control and prevail.

                        <br /><br />

                        b. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 18.B.1.b, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and FriendComp may litigate in court to (I) compel arbitration or other specific performance, (II) stay proceedings pending arbitration, (III) obtain, on an interim basis (and in aid of the arbitration either to be initiated or already in process between the parties), injunctive relief, (IV) receive other appropriate equitable recourse of a provisional, precautionary or conservatory nature, or (V) confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision will be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.

                        <br /><br />

                        B.4 Arbitration Fees.

                        <br /><br />

                        If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will only need to pay an arbitration initiation fee of $250 and we will pay all other costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. Notwithstanding Section 18.A, you will not be required to pay our fees or other costs if you do not prevail in the arbitration.

                        <br /><br />

                        The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify FriendComp in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of FriendComp’s arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or Internet connection appearances.

                        <br /><br />

                        B.6 Limitations.

                        <br /><br />

                        You and FriendComp agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between FriendComp and you individually. YOU AND FRIENDCOMP AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION WILL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.

                        <br /><br />

                        B.7 Severability.

                        <br /><br />

                        If Section 18.B.1.b above is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor FriendComp will elect to arbitrate any dispute, controversy or claim falling within that portion of Section 18.B.1.b above found to be illegal or unenforceable and such dispute, controversy or claim will be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Hawaii, United States of America, and you and FriendComp agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                        <br /><br />

                        C. Injunctive Relief.

                        <br /><br />

                        Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 18, in any dispute, controversy or claim, you and FriendComp acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to provide full compensation in the event of a material breach relating to one of your respective obligations (including, without limitation, involving the intellectual property of a party) and/or representations and warranties hereunder, and the non-breaching party shall therefore be entitled to obtain injunctive relief in the event of any such breach, without having to prove damages or post a bond.

                        <br /><br />

                        1. General
                        This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of FriendComp’s policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information about you that directly or indirectly may be referable to you, such as your name, email address, FriendComp user ID number and also transactional information and other information (”Personal Data”) that you submit or disclose to FriendComp when accessing the FriendComp Platform and/or using the FriendComp Services (irrespective of whether it is public or non-public information).
                        <br /><br />
                        2. Definitions
                        In this Privacy Policy the terms (identified with initial capitalization) used herein shall have the meanings specified in the Terms of Service (available at http://www.FriendComp.com/tos). Additional definitions are also provided in this Privacy Policy.
                        <br /><br />
                        In this Privacy Policy, “FriendComp” means   a company registered under the laws of the state of Delaware, with its registered address 1439A Akuleana Place, Kailua Hawaii, 96734, United States.
                        <br /><br />
                        3. User Consent
                        By registering a FriendComp Account and accessing the FriendComp Platform from your Device, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data as we have outlined in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and forms part of our Terms of Service. You unconditionally consent to FriendComp’s collection and processing of your Personal Data as specified in this Privacy Policy (and as amended from time to time) by allowing the FriendComp Platform to access your Facebook or other Social Network account.
                        <br /><br />
                        4. Controller of Personal Data
                        FriendComp is committed to protecting your Personal Data at all times and the Personal Data will not be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent to pursuant to this Privacy Policy or which is not permitted under applicable laws.
                        <br /><br />
                        5. Age Restrictions
                        Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use FriendComp Services, and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Data from persons who are under the age of 13. By using FriendComp Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age, or that you are between 13 and 17 years of age and have a parent’s or guardian’s permission to use FriendComp Services. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Data from a person under the age of 13 or a person between 13 and 17 years of age who does not have a parent’s or a guardian’s consent to use FriendComp Services, we will take steps to remove that person’s Personal Data permanently from our databases.
                        <br /><br />
                        6. Collection of Personal Data
                        Personal Data That You Provide
                        It is our ambition to make your use of the FriendComp Platform and FriendComp Services a good experience.
                        <br /><br />
                        FriendComp collects information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Data, within the FriendComp Platform. FriendComp collects Personal Data about you and your friends who use FriendComp Services, from you and from the Social Network connected to the FriendComp Platform (including your profile photo), in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. We may collect information from your Social Network profile that you have permitted to be displayed through the FriendComp Platform and we may also collect information that you submit when using FriendComp Services. For example, when you send a Gift Credit to your friends, we collect and associate certain of your non-personally identifiable demographic information (like age, gender and general location) with the specific merchant (“Merchant”) for the Gift Credit in order to create a better and more sophisticated product experience. We may also request optional information from you to support and enhance your use of FriendComp Services.
                        <br /><br />
                        The information relating to you that is being processed by FriendComp includes:
                        <br /><br />
                        Identification data (e.g. name, email address);
                        Profile information (e.g. age, gender, nationality);
                        Electronic identification data (e.g. IP address, cookies); and
                        Content that you submit during your use of FriendComp Services, such as photos, reviews, greetings and other information you choose to submit.
                        When you purchase a Paid Gift Credit, you will need to submit credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for the Gift Credit. All payments are processed with due observance of any applicable security obligations.
                        <br /><br />
                        When you sign up for or win any contests, sweepstakes or other activities that we make available on the FriendComp Platform, we will also collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number in order to provide you with FriendComp Services.
                        <br /><br />
                        Personal Data from Other Sources
                        We may receive Personal Data about you from other sources such as the Social Network connected to the FriendComp Platform, as well as Merchants and other third parties that help us improve your experience of FriendComp Services and generally make FriendComp Services better. FriendComp may associate this information with the other Personal Data that FriendComp has collected about you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Email and Email Addresses
                        If you send an email to us or fill out our “Feedback” form through the FriendComp Platform, we will collect your email address and the full content of your email, including attached files and other information you provide in order to document and to further develop FriendComp Services based on user feedback. If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback to our Merchants to improve or modify FriendComp Services.
                        <br /><br />
                        FriendComp may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through the FriendComp Platform or the Social Network connected to FriendComp Services (such as in an invitation or when sharing your content).  
                        <br /><br />
                        If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, FriendComp may collect your email address and other related information also for that purpose. FriendComp may use this email address to contact you for things such as notifications of limited-edition shop sales and other related advertisement information. You may at any time opt-out from any further advertisements to your email address by sending a notice to FriendComp at support@FriendComp.com.
                        <br /><br />
                        Information Collected via Technology
                        As you use FriendComp Services, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your IP address, browser type and operating system. We may also use cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (”URLs”) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the FriendComp Platform you clicked. This type of information is collected to make FriendComp Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with FriendComp Services to meet your special interests and needs.
                        <br /><br />
                        For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access the FriendComp Platform to assist with ad targeting. An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session, but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session.
                        <br /><br />
                        Cookies
                        “Cookies” are small pieces of information that FriendComp sends to and stores on the Device that you use when accessing the FriendComp Platform.
                        <br /><br />
                        FriendComp uses cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the FriendComp Platform and to improve FriendComp Services. Cookies help us evaluate what types of information that might be of interest to you and other users, to improve our and our Merchants’ advertisements and to protect you and FriendComp from unlawful activities. We also use cookies to know when you are interacting with Merchants or other third parties.
                        <br /><br />
                        In order to use FriendComp Services, your Device must accept cookies. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following your Internet browser´s help file directions. But some aspects of the FriendComp Platform may not work properly and you may not be able to use FriendComp Services if our cookies are removed or blocked.
                        <br /><br />
                        Location
                        If the settings on your Device allow us to receive location information, FriendComp will collect that information in order to provide you with a more geographically targeted experience of FriendComp Services and provide you with nearby offers, Merchant information, etc.
                        <br /><br />
                        7. Use and Disclosure of Personal Data
                        Personal Data that you submit to us is used by FriendComp to provide you with access to the FriendComp Platform and FriendComp Services; to administer your FriendComp Account; to improve FriendComp Services; to better tailor the features, performance and support of the FriendComp Platform; and to offer you additional information, advertisements, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us (including in cases when we contact you in connection with specific Merchant advertisements, opportunities and promotions).
                        <br /><br />
                        FriendComp may provide your Personal Data to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of the FriendComp Platform and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments) and providing customer service. Such third-party service providers may only process Personal Data to provide the relevant services to FriendComp and in accordance with FriendComp’s instructions.
                        <br /><br />
                        The Personal Data that you provide will allow FriendComp to inform you of FriendComp Services, such as available Gift Credits as well as other services and products that may be of interest to you. FriendComp may use your Personal Data for processing, managing and providing you with retail offers, advertisements and other information related to your profile and interests. By using FriendComp Services you agree that FriendComp may contact you to conduct targeted advertising based on the information provided by you and collected by FriendComp. This type of targeting is performed to make FriendComp Services and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with the FriendComp Platform to meet your special interests and needs. Sometimes this type of targeting and other offers, advertisements and promotions is performed by FriendComp on behalf of Merchants. FriendComp does not disclose your Personal Data to Merchants, but may make certain of your non-personally identifiable demographic information (like age, gender and general location) available in connection with our agreements with Merchants. None of the information provided to Merchants would allow them to identify you or your Personal Data.
                        <br /><br />
                        We may promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the FriendComp Platform on behalf of Merchants and ad servers. These Merchants may use cookies and/or “Web Beacons” (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of such Merchants. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any such Merchants, as further described in Section 7 (Third-Party Websites) in the Terms of Service.
                        <br /><br />
                        Your Personal Data may also form part of FriendComp’s statistics but then we will exclude, for instance, your name. FriendComp will generally aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of FriendComp Services and to help Merchants indirectly (via FriendComp) target users with the desired demographics.
                        <br /><br />
                        In the event FriendComp is subject to a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a sale of all or a portion of FriendComp’s assets, your Personal Data may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of FriendComp or its assets may continue to process your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
                        <br /><br />
                        In addition to the above, FriendComp may disclose your Personal Data if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on FriendComp or pursuant to any other legal claims or (b) to protect and defend FriendComp’s rights, property or interests or (c) to protect your rights or any third-party rights or (d) fight against fraud or (e) to enforce our policies (including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service).
                        <br /><br />
                        8. Ability to View Your Information
                        When you register a FriendComp Account, your Social Network friends will be notified of your use of FriendComp Services. Your Social Network friends with FriendComp accounts will then be able to give you electronic Gift Credits provided by various Merchants.
                        <br /><br />
                        It is up to you to make sure that you are comfortable with the information that you choose to provide to FriendComp and the information you choose to publish either directly on the FriendComp Platform or through your Social Network, which is connected to the FriendComp Platform.
                        <br /><br />
                        You acknowledge that when you use FriendComp Services, certain information that you post or provide through the FriendComp Platform (such as your name, profile, comments, collections and reviews,) may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of the FriendComp Platform, including, without limitation, social media applications and other public fora (plural for forums ☺) in which you choose to participate. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose Personal Data when posting comments or other information or content through the FriendComp Platform, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others, including people outside the FriendComp Platform. We will not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post via the FriendComp Platform and make available to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out Personal Data to others through Social Networks.
                        <br /><br />
                        9. Security of Collected Information
                        FriendComp is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We will take appropriate technical and organizational measures with due observance of the applicable obligations under relevant legislation to protect provided or otherwise collected Personal Data and traffic data. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized or unlawful access, use or disclosure and accidental loss, destruction and damage. Even though FriendComp has taken significant steps to protect your Personal Data, no company, including ours, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.
                        <br /><br />
                        10. Access to, Rectifying and Deleting Your Personal Data
                        You are entitled, once a year, to request information from FriendComp about the Personal Data relating to you which is being processed by FriendComp and to request, where relevant, that such Personal Data is rectified by sending a notice to FriendComp at the following address:
                        <br /><br />
                        FriendComp
                        1439A Akuleana Place
                        Kailua, Hawaii 96734
                        <br /><br /><br /><br />

                        FriendComp will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate a request to delete Personal Data, unless such data is required to be retained pursuant to applicable laws, or for lawful business purposes, or to protect and defend FriendComp’s rights, property or interests, or to fight against fraud, or to enforce our policies (including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service).

                        You may also, at any time, ask us to discontinue processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes by notifying us at the address above that you would like us to stop sending you promotional communications.
