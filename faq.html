                                      It depends on the situation. If you gave a paid gift credit to a friend who has used the card, no refunds are allowed.  We can cancel the purchase if it is under 14 days since you sent It -  if the gift credit is unused. You can request a refund by contacting customer support by email: support@FriendComp.com.

                                      A gift credit is removed from your FriendComp account for one of four reasons:
                                </p><p>
                                      1. It has already been redeemed for a product or service.
                                </p><p>
                                      2. The card has expired and is no longer valid for use.
                                </p><p>
                                      The friend who sent you a paid gift credit has cancelled the purchase. (Sorry!)
                                </p><p>

                                      The easiest solution is to borrow a friend's smartphone, access your email, and click on the link to redeem.
